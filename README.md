# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Daniel Chen**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Astrology Image of the Day** is an android app that **displays the daily image of space from the NASA APOD API.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üåé‚≠êü§©**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **NASA APOD API**.
